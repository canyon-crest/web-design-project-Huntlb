    <h3>Taekwondo Black Belt</h3>
    <p>

    I’m a <span class=highlight>first degree black belt in taekwondo</span>, which I’ve been doing for a couple of years at Church’s ATA. My taekwondo has taught me discipline, patience, and many other important values that have helped me become a far better person. I especially enjoy sparring, where I get to test my speed, skill, strategy, and reflexes in a competition-like manner. One day, I hope to earn the opportunity to teach taekwondo myself and pass on the same lessons that have been given to me, which have helped to shape me into the person I am today.<br><br>

    <h3>Hobbies and Relaxation</h3>

    <img src="images/math.png" width="200px" id="pic2" class="img-zoom">
    When I’m not doing taekwondo, I love studying math and spending time with my dogs/family. I’m incredibly interested in mathematics, and I’m taking <span class="highlight">Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra</span> to continue fueling my passion. I also hope to write a paper (preferably more than one) about concepts like <span class="highlight">topology, graph theory, and fractals</span>. Outside of my interest in math, I also love spending time with my dogs, friends, and family. Any bad day/week can easily be fixed with my late night walks with my dog or just quality time with family and friends.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown" target="_blank">Cool youtube channel for math</a>

    <h3>F1 Enthusiast</h3>

    <p><img src="images/f1ferrari.jpeg" width="300px" id="pic3" class="img-zoom float-left">
    Well I’m not necessarily a full fanatic, however I still watch F1 races weekly and keep up to track with the drivers. <span class="highlight">My favorite driver is Carlos Sainz, as he’s STILL Ferrari's last race winner (and probably still will be when you are reading this)</span>. I normally watch races with my family while doing homework or something, it's a pretty fun experience overall. Maybe in a different life I could be a racecar driver, although it also does seem a bit dangerous.
